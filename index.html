            <h2>Hi, I'm Tobin</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a data scientist with a passion for interesting problems. I'm from Adelaide, Australia but heading to MIT for a PhD in September on a Fulbright Scholarship. 

            <p>
                Previously I completed a Masters of Philosophy in Applied Mathematics and Data Science at The University of Adelaide where my research focused 
                on networks of natural language information flow. Between these studies I have run the Bayesian arm of the COVID-19 forecasting for the Australian Federal government.
            </p>
            <p>
            	More broadly, my interests lie at the intersections of complex networks, machine learning, economics or social science. That's a broad intersection, but life is full of interesting questions.
        	</p>
            <p>
            	When I'm not doing work, I can often be overheard trying to convince undergraduates to get involved in data science and mathematics. I was Valedictorian of the graduating class of Mathematics, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and was an active member of student societies throughout my Bachelors. Before that, I grew up in the "Peanut capital of Australia", the agricultural town of

            </p>
            <p>
            Don't hesitate to reach out if you have something interesting to talk about. </p>

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p> I have always had a passion for teaching, and I've taken several oppertunites to teach and design courses. This has included roles as joint-lecturer for a introductory postgraduate computer science course, practical laboratory tutor for data science courses, and workshop tutor for professional skills courses. Here is a few pieces of student feedback from the anonymous assessment of teaching quality surveyed each semester. 
            <blockquote>
            	<q>Very well versed in material, very outgoing and friendly, easy to talk to and genuinely interested in helping our improvement and learning.</q>
        	</blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            	<q>He teaches with enthusiasm. He is always excited to teach new concepts. He clears everyoneâ€™s doubts with patience. </q>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            	<q>Please let Tobin be the main Lecturer. It could save students.</q>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Professional Work</h2>
            <p> I work casually as a advisory consultant for NLP and open data projects at the AI consulting group Brainframe. I have been involved since Brainframe acquired my open-data analysis start-up in 2019. Recently, I have co-founded a new start-up called ClearerConsent, which aims to get digitalise our informed consent technology in healthcare to support the culturally diverse backgrounds of Australians. This company was formed after winning the Google Cloud Platform Prize at the Queensland AI Hub Medical Datathon.
